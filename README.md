# Povy the Alien
Povy the Alien is a science fiction, 2D Top-down RPG I am currently developing that incorporates turn-based fighting and is developed in Java. 

# Motivation
I began work on this project in the summer of 2018 as I am very intrigued by the world of game development. I originally wrote the story for the game in elementary school, which is part of the reason I've been so dedicated to developing this project. My goal for the project is to create a game that is enjoyable and that I am proud of, as well as to learn different aspects of game development and help kickstart a career in games!

# Features
The story follows an alien named Povy, who stumbles upon a crystal that gives him great power. The game follows his adventure as he tries to avoid enemies who seek this power while trying to find his family and friends throughout the galaxy. 
# Non-Combat Gameplay
The non-combat gameplay is rather simple in that it mostly consists of navigating the map, solving puzzles, avoiding traps, and opening chests for items.

# Combat Gameplay
In the turn-based combat mode, Povy's attack menu consists of two regular attacks, laser blaster and pummel, which can be further upgraded with experience from defeating enemies. There is a run option to attempt escaping the battle and an item option to use an item acquired during gameplay (health, attack boost, defense boost). There is also an ally option: allies are different NPCs that Povy encounters throughout his journey. Every ally has a different type of way to aid Povy, and once they ally meter is fully charged, Povy can call on one of them during battle. Lastly, there is a "special" option, which once a certain combo of moves is used, Povy can utilize the power he gained from the crystal. New combos and "special" attacks are unlocked as the game progresses and Povy learns to control the power bestowed upon him. Once a move is selected, the enemy-turn with consist of an action, usually an attack on Povy. Once an enemy is defeated, Povy will gain experience. Once enough experience is gained, the user can upgrade one of four areas: health, ally moves, laser blaster, or pummel.
